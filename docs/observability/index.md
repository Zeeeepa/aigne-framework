### Install via Blocklet

You can also directly install the [AIGNE Observability Blocklet](https://store.blocklet.dev/blocklets/z2qa2GCqPJkufzqF98D8o7PWHrRRSHpYkNhEh) to use the observability functionality in a Blocklet environment.

All Blocklets using the AIGNE Framework automatically integrate observability functionality, providing complete observability support without additional configuration.
