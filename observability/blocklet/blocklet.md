# AIGNE Observability

**See what your agents see. Understand what they do.**

[AIGNE Observability](https://www.aigne.io/observability) gives developers full visibility into their AI agents and applications with zero manual instrumentation. Built on open standards like OpenTelemetry, it captures and visualizes every decision, tool invocation, and token usage—so you can build smarter and ship with confidence.

## ✨ Why AIGNE Observability?

LLM agents don’t always do what you expect. For any agent you create, visibility is your only defense against failure, hallucinations, and “best guess” debugging. Built with open standards, AIGNE Observability puts every decision, tool run, and token spend at your fingertips

- **Visualize Every Agent Step**
  Follow your agent's real-time execution path. See every tool call, decision, and API request in an interactive graph

- **Pinpoint Costs & Bottlenecks**
  Monitor token consumption and latency per run. Identify expensive steps and performance issues before they reach production

- **Automatic Instrumentation**
  No extra code required. Import the library and traces are captured automatically

- **Find the Root Cause**
  Go from a failed run to the exact error in one click. View the specific logs, inputs, and context needed to debug

- **Collaborate on Traces**
  Share a direct link to any execution trace. Work with your team to find and fix bugs faster

## 🧪 How It Works

Observability is enabled by default in the AIGNE Framework.

- **Automatic Tracing**
  Observability is enabled by default in the AIGNE Framework. All runs are recorded.

- **Step-by-Step Visualization**
  Visualize tool calls, token usage, and latency over time in one dashboard.

- **Debug in One Click**
  Find failed runs, click into the logs, and identify root causes instantly.

- **Share with Your Team**
  Every trace has a permanent link—great for reviews, debugging, or incident response.
