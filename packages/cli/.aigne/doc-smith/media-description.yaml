    description: This image is a clear, step-by-step flowchart illustrating the
      "AIGNE Deployment Process." It details the sequence of actions from
      initiating a deploy command and preparing the environment, including a
      conditional check for '@blocklet/cli' installation, through to
      configuration, bundling, and final deployment to an endpoint. The diagram
      effectively uses icons and distinct colors for the start and end states to
      visually guide the user through the technical workflow.

    description: This diagram illustrates the core architectural components of an AI
      agent system, detailing the relationships between Project Configuration,
      an Agents Directory, and a Skills Directory. It shows how a Chat Agent,
      defined within the Agents Directory, interacts with both a Sandbox Skill
      from the Skills Directory and an external AI Model Service. The visual
      uses distinct color-coded sections and clear arrows to represent
      dependencies and data flow.

    description: This diagram illustrates the architectural process flow between an
      "Agent (Reasoning & Orchestration)" and "Skills (Execution & Tools)". It
      details how an Agent receives user input, maintains context, reasons to
      select a skill, and then uses the skill's execution result to generate a
      user response. The flow highlights the involvement of Agent Definitions,
      Skill Metadata, and the specific steps for skill execution.
