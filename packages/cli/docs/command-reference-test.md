# aigne test

The `aigne test` command executes automated tests for your agents and skills. It provides a built-in mechanism for unit and integration testing to ensure your agents and the tools they rely on function correctly before deployment.

## Usage

```bash Basic Syntax icon=lucide:terminal
aigne test [path]
```

## Arguments

| Argument      | Description                                                                                                |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `[path]`      | Optional. The path to the directory containing your agents and their corresponding test files. If omitted, the command searches for tests in the current directory. |

## Description

The command automatically discovers and runs test files within your project. For instance, the default AIGNE project template includes a `sandbox.test.js` file designed to verify the functionality of the `sandbox.js` skill. The `aigne test` command will execute such files to validate your agent's capabilities.

## Examples

### Run tests in the current directory

To execute test cases for the AIGNE project located in your current working directory, run the command without any arguments:

```bash icon=lucide:terminal
aigne test
```

### Run tests in a specific directory

If your agents are located in a different directory, you can specify the path to that directory:

```bash icon=lucide:terminal
aigne test path/to/agents
```

## Next Steps

After ensuring your agents pass all tests, you can proceed to serve them for integration or deploy them as a service.
