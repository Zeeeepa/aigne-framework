This is a demonstration of using [AIGNE Framework](https://github.com/AIGNE-io/aigne-framework) to build a sequential workflow. The example now supports both one-shot and interactive chat modes, along with customizable model settings and pipeline input/output.

## Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (>=20.0) and npm installed on your machine
* An [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) for interacting with OpenAI's services
* Optional dependencies (if running the example from source code):
  * [Bun](https://bun.sh) for running unit tests & examples
  * [Pnpm](https://pnpm.io) for package management

## Quick Start (No Installation Required)

### Run the Example

```bash
# Run in one-shot mode (default)
npx -y @aigne/example-workflow-sequential

# Run in interactive chat mode
npx -y @aigne/example-workflow-sequential --interactive

# Use pipeline input
echo "Create marketing content for our new AI-powered fitness app" | npx -y @aigne/example-workflow-sequential
```

### Connect to an AI Model

As an example, running `npx -y @aigne/example-workflow-sequential --interactive` requires an AI model. If this is your first run, you need to connect one.

![run example](./run-example.png)

- Connect via the official AIGNE Hub

Choose the first option and your browser will open the official AIGNE Hub page. Follow the prompts to complete the connection. If you're a new user, the system automatically grants 400,000 tokens for you to use.

![connect to official aigne hub](../images/connect-to-aigne-hub.png)

- Connect via a self-hosted AIGNE Hub

Choose the second option, enter the URL of your self-hosted AIGNE Hub, and follow the prompts to complete the connection. If you need to set up a self-hosted AIGNE Hub, visit the Blocklet Store to install and deploy it: [Blocklet Store](https://store.blocklet.dev/blocklets/z8ia3xzq2tMq8CRHfaXj1BTYJyYnEcHbqP8cJ?utm_source=www.arcblock.io&utm_medium=blog_link&utm_campaign=default&utm_content=store.blocklet.dev#:~:text=%F0%9F%9A%80%20Get%20Started%20in%20Minutes).

![connect to self hosted aigne hub](../images/connect-to-self-hosted-aigne-hub.png)

- Connect via a third-party model provider

Using OpenAI as an example, you can configure the provider's API key via environment variables. After configuration, run the example again:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="" # Set your OpenAI API key here
```
For more details on third-party model configuration (e.g., OpenAI, DeepSeek, Google Gemini), see [.env.local.example](./.env.local.example).

After configuration, run the example again.

### Debugging

The `aigne observe` command starts a local web server to monitor and analyze agent execution data. It provides a user-friendly interface to inspect traces, view detailed call information, and understand your agent’s behavior during runtime. This tool is essential for debugging, performance tuning, and gaining insight into how your agent processes information and interacts with tools and models.

Start the observation server.

## Installation

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AIGNE-io/aigne-framework
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
cd aigne-framework/examples/workflow-sequential

pnpm install
```

### Run the Example

```bash
pnpm start # Run in one-shot mode (default)

# Run in interactive chat mode
pnpm start -- --interactive

# Use pipeline input
echo "Create marketing content for our new AI-powered fitness app" | pnpm start
```

### Run Options

The example supports the following command-line parameters:

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `--interactive` | Run in interactive chat mode | Disabled (one-shot mode) |
| `--model <provider[:model]>` | AI model to use in format 'provider\[:model]' where model is optional. Examples: 'openai' or 'openai:gpt-4o-mini' | openai |
| `--temperature <value>` | Temperature for model generation | Provider default |
| `--top-p <value>` | Top-p sampling value | Provider default |
| `--presence-penalty <value>` | Presence penalty value | Provider default |
| `--frequency-penalty <value>` | Frequency penalty value | Provider default |
| `--log-level <level>` | Set logging level (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE) | INFO |
| `--input`, `-i <input>` | Specify input directly | None |

#### Examples

```bash
# Run in chat mode (interactive)
pnpm start -- --interactive

# Set logging level
pnpm start -- --log-level DEBUG

# Use pipeline input
echo "Create marketing content for our new AI-powered fitness app" | pnpm start
```

## Example

The following example demonstrates how to build a sequential workflow:

```typescript
import { AIAgent, AIGNE, ProcessMode, TeamAgent } from "@aigne/core";
import { OpenAIChatModel } from "@aigne/core/models/openai-chat-model.js";

const { OPENAI_API_KEY } = process.env;

const model = new OpenAIChatModel({
  apiKey: OPENAI_API_KEY,
});

const conceptExtractor = AIAgent.from({
  instructions: `\
You are a marketing analyst. Give a product description, identity:
- Key features
- Target audience
- Unique selling points

Product description:
{{product}}`,
  outputKey: "concept",
});

const writer = AIAgent.from({
  instructions: `\
You are a marketing copywriter. Given a block of text describing features, audience, and USPs,
compose a compelling marketing copy (like a newsletter section) that highlights these points.
Output should be short (around 150 words), output just the copy as a single text block.

Product description:
{{product}}

Below is the info about the product:
{{concept}}`,
  outputKey: "draft",
});

const formatProof = AIAgent.from({
  instructions: `\
You are an editor. Given the draft copy, correct grammar, improve clarity, ensure consistent tone,
give format and make it polished. Output the final improved copy as a single text block.

Product description:
{{product}}

Below is the info about the product:
{{concept}}

Draft copy:
{{draft}}`,
  outputKey: "content",
});

const aigne = new AIGNE({ model });

// 创建一个 TeamAgent 来处理顺序工作流
const teamAgent = TeamAgent.from({
  skills: [conceptExtractor, writer, formatProof],
  mode: ProcessMode.sequential, // 默认值，可以省略
});

const result = await aigne.invoke(teamAgent, {
  product: "AIGNE is a No-code Generative AI Apps Engine",
});

console.log(result);

// Output:
// {
//   concept: "**Product Description: AIGNE - No-code Generative AI Apps Engine**\n\nAIGNE is a cutting-edge No-code Generative AI Apps Engine designed to empower users to seamlessly create ...",
//   draft: "Unlock the power of creation with AIGNE, the revolutionary No-code Generative AI Apps Engine! Whether you're a small business looking to streamline operations, an entrepreneur ...",
//   content: "Unlock the power of creation with AIGNE, the revolutionary No-Code Generative AI Apps Engine! Whether you are a small business aiming to streamline operations, an entrepreneur ...",
// }
```
