This example demonstrates how to create a chatbot with image capabilities using the [AIGNE Framework](https://github.com/AIGNE-io/aigne-framework) and [AIGNE CLI](https://github.com/AIGNE-io/aigne-framework/blob/main/packages/cli/README.md).

## Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (>=20.0) and npm installed on your machine
* An [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) for interacting with OpenAI's services
* Optional dependencies (if running the example from source code):
  * [Pnpm](https://pnpm.io) for package management
  * [Bun](https://bun.sh) for running unit tests & examples

## Quick Start (No Installation Required)

### Run the Example

```bash
npx -y @aigne/example-nano-banana --input 'Draw an image of a lovely cat'

# Run in interactive chat mode
npx -y @aigne/example-nano-banana --chat
```

### Connect to an AI Model

As an example, running `npx -y @aigne/example-nano-banana --input 'Draw an image of a lovely cat'` requires an AI model. If this is your first run, you need to connect one.

- Connect via the official AIGNE Hub

Choose the first option and your browser will open the official AIGNE Hub page. Follow the prompts to complete the connection. If you're a new user, the system automatically grants 400,000 tokens for you to use.

- Connect via a self-hosted AIGNE Hub

Choose the second option, enter the URL of your self-hosted AIGNE Hub, and follow the prompts to complete the connection. If you need to set up a self-hosted AIGNE Hub, visit the Blocklet Store to install and deploy it: [Blocklet Store](https://store.blocklet.dev/blocklets/z8ia3xzq2tMq8CRHfaXj1BTYJyYnEcHbqP8cJ?utm_source=www.arcblock.io&utm_medium=blog_link&utm_campaign=default&utm_content=store.blocklet.dev#:~:text=%F0%9F%9A%80%20Get%20Started%20in%20Minutes).

- Connect via a third-party model provider

Using OpenAI as an example, you can configure the provider's API key via environment variables. After configuration, run the example again:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="" # Set your OpenAI API key here
```
For more details on third-party model configuration (e.g., OpenAI, DeepSeek, Google Gemini), see [.env.local.example](./.env.local.example).

After configuration, run the example again.

### Debugging

The `aigne observe` command starts a local web server to monitor and analyze agent execution data. It provides a user-friendly interface to inspect traces, view detailed call information, and understand your agent’s behavior during runtime. This tool is essential for debugging, performance tuning, and gaining insight into how your agent processes information and interacts with tools and models.

Start the observation server.
